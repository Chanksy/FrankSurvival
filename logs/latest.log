[00:17:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Chanksy> logically 2 makes sense bc of the shutters
[00:17:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <LazyPotatoJoe> right
[00:18:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <LazyPotatoJoe> or no shutters on the left side
[00:18:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Chanksy> but 4 also looks pretty nice
[00:18:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Chanksy> oh the 3 was to match the top floor?
[00:18:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <LazyPotatoJoe> wasnt intentional
[00:18:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Chanksy> lmao
